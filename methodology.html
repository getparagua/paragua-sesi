    <h2>High-level overview (v0.1, frozen)</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">
      SESI is designed to be simple to read: a 0–100 historical ranking of stress.
      This page explains what SESI measures, how to interpret it, and how the public validation is computed.
    </p>
  </div>

  <section>
    <h3>Concept</h3>
    <p>
      SESI measures <strong>stress regimes</strong> in the Spanish power market.
      It is not trying to predict a specific price.
      It is trying to answer:
      <strong>“Are we in a calm regime, or in a regime where the market tends to move a lot?”</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      SESI combines three complementary dimensions:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Price level</strong>: how far prices are from a long-term historical baseline</li>
      <li><strong>Short-term tension</strong>: unusual recent price behavior</li>
      <li><strong>Market turbulence</strong>: how intense recent volatility has been</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="callout">
      <p style="margin:0;">
        SESI is a <strong>benchmark</strong> for risk communication and regime monitoring.
        It is <strong>not</strong> a trading signal.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>How to read a percentile</h3>

    <p>
      SESI is published as a number from <strong>0 to 100</strong>.
      Think of it like a <strong>ranking</strong>.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      If SESI is <em>80</em>, it means today looks more stressed than about <em>80%</em> of historical days
      (in the chosen reference set).
    </blockquote>

    <p class="muted">
      Percentiles are historical rankings, not probabilities.
      A percentile does not mean “80% chance of something happening”.
      It only means “this is high compared to history”.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Three views: Realized vs Structural vs Expected</h3>
    <p>
      SESI is published through three aligned views:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>SESI (realized)</strong>: what is happening now in spot (OMIE day-ahead).</li>
      <li><strong>SESI_structural</strong>: how tight the background regime is vs the pre-2022 reference period.</li>
      <li><strong>Expected stress (OMIP)</strong>: what forward prices imply for the next months (rank vs pre-2022).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Comparing <strong>Expected</strong> vs <strong>Structural</strong> helps identify <strong>dislocations</strong>:
      situations where forward prices look much calmer (or much more stressed) than the background regime.
    </p>

    <p class="muted">
      Dislocation is expressed in percentile points:
      <strong>D = Expected − Structural</strong>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Regime map (quadrants)</h3>
    <p>
      SESI also supports a simple regime map using two axes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>X-axis</strong>: SESI_structural (0–100)</li>
      <li><strong>Y-axis</strong>: SESI (0–100)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Using a threshold (e.g. <strong>80</strong>), each day falls into one of four regimes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Calm</strong>: low realized, low structural</li>
      <li><strong>Latent risk</strong>: low realized, high structural</li>
      <li><strong>Realized stress</strong>: high realized, low structural</li>
      <li><strong>Full crisis</strong>: high realized, high structural</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="muted">
      The threshold is a practical way to separate “normal” from “high-stress” regimes.
      It is not a rule and it is not a forecast.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Public validation: “what usually happens next”</h3>

    <p>
      SESI includes a public validation that answers a simple question:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      When SESI was high in the past, how much did the market typically move afterwards?
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This is computed using <strong>historical conditional outcomes</strong>.
      That means:
      we look at days matching a condition (example: <strong>SESI &gt; 80</strong>),
      and then measure what happened in the next <strong>7 / 14 / 30</strong> days.
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
      <p style="margin:0;">
        Validation is <strong>descriptive</strong>, not predictive.
        It summarizes history. It does not claim an edge or a trading rule.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h4 style="margin-top:16px;">Outcome metrics (simple definitions)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Future max absolute move (7D / 14D / 30D)</strong>:
        in the next N days, what was the largest change from today’s price, regardless of direction.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Future max up move</strong>:
        the largest increase from today’s price within the next N days.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Future max down move</strong>:
        the largest decrease from today’s price within the next N days.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Volatility expansion (7D)</strong>:
        how much 7-day volatility increased after today compared to the 7 days before today.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spike frequency (next 30D)</strong>:
        the share of days in the next 30 days where the daily move exceeded a fixed threshold
        (e.g., <strong>20 €/MWh</strong>) or a volatility-scaled threshold.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="muted">
      In the dashboard, we usually show medians (typical outcomes) and sample sizes (how many historical days were included).
