    <p>
      SESI is currently published as a <strong>visual market benchmark</strong>.
      At this stage, SESI is not distributed as a downloadable dataset.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is a deliberate product choice: SESI is designed as a
      <strong>market signal and communication tool</strong>, not as a raw data dump.
