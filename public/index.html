    <h3>What is SESI?</h3>
    <p>
      SESI is an independent market signal designed to track stress regimes in the Spanish
      electricity market. It combines realized spot stress, structural regime distance, and
      forward-looking market expectations into a single, interpretable framework.
    </p>
    <p>
      SESI is published daily and is intended for <strong>risk communication and regime monitoring</strong>,
      not for short-term trading.
