    <p class="subtitle">High-level overview (v0.1, frozen)</p>

  <section>
    <h3>Concept</h3>
    <p>
      SESI (Spain Energy Stress Index) measures stress regimes in the Spanish power market
      by combining three complementary dimensions:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Price level</strong> — distance from long-term historical baselines</li>
      <li><strong>Short-term tension</strong> — unusual recent price movements</li>
      <li><strong>Market turbulence</strong> — intensity of recent volatility</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      These dimensions are aggregated into a daily stress signal and mapped into
      <strong>percentile space</strong> for intuitive interpretation.
    </p>
  </section>

    <h3>Percentile interpretation</h3>
    <p>
      SESI is expressed as a percentile relative to its own historical distribution.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      A percentile of <em>p</em> indicates that the current level of stress is lower than
      approximately <em>(100 − p)%</em> of days in the reference period.
    </blockquote>
    <p class="muted">
      Percentiles represent historical ranking, not probabilities.
    </p>

    <h3>Realized vs structural vs expected stress</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>SESI</strong>: realized (spot) market stress, updated daily</li>
      <li><strong>SESI_structural</strong>: distance from the pre-2022 structural regime</li>
      <li><strong>Expected stress</strong>: forward-looking expectations derived from OMIP futures</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Comparing these dimensions allows the identification of <strong>dislocations</strong>
      between current stress conditions and how the market prices future risk.

    <h3>What SESI is — and what it is not</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>SESI is a <strong>market regime indicator</strong></li>
      <li>SESI is designed for <strong>risk communication and monitoring</strong></li>
      <li>SESI is <strong>not</strong> a trading signal</li>
      <li>SESI is <strong>not</strong> a probabilistic forecast</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Data sources</h3>
    <p>
      SESI is built exclusively using publicly available market data:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>OMIE — Spanish day-ahead power market marginal prices</li>
      <li>OMIP — Iberian power futures settlement prices (Month contracts)</li>
      <li>Yahoo Finance — continuous TTF natural gas futures (TTF=F)</li>
    </ul>

      No proprietary, internal, or confidential data sources are used.
